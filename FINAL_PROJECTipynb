        "  ▶ What is an **option**?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  An option is a financial contract that gives someone the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell something in the future, like a stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A call option = right to buy\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A put option = right to sell\n",

        "\n",
        "▶ What is an **American Option**?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - European option: can only be exercised at the end\n",
        "\n",
        "  - American option: can be exercised at any time before or on the expiration date\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "▶  Why are American Options **harder to value**?\n",
        "\n",
        "Because we do not know when the holder will choose to exercise it. We need a smart way to decide if holding the option is better than using it right now.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "▶  We introduce: **Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm**\n",
        "\n",
        "This algorithm helps us estimate the best time to exercise an American option.\n",
        "It works like this:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  1. Simulate multiple price paths for the underlying stock.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. At each time step, calculate:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The immediate payoff from exercising\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The expected value of holding it longer (using regression)\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Exercise the option if it is better than holding it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Repeat for many paths and average results to estimate the option’s value."
